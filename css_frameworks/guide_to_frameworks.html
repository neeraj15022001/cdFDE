			When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. 
			You are choosing when and where to call the library. 
			<br/>
			When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. 
			It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.
		   </p>
		   <p>
			Frameworks and libraries are both code written by someone else that helps you perform some common tasks in a less verbose way.
			<br/>A framework inverts the control of the program. It tells the developer what they need. A library doesn’t. The programmer calls the library where and when they need it.
			<br/>The degree of freedom a library or framework gives the developer will dictate how “opinionated” it is.

		   Instructor Note: This is highly debatable topic, whether bootstrap is framework or library. I'd suggest you to go over it and understand the functionality for now.
